/**
 * Keeps a control that is played by dragging from being taken for a drag of the view behind it.
 * Consuming its press and drag events stops a pannable ScrollPane from moving, but not from
 * switching to its move cursor: the pane does that when the scene announces a drag's start, a
 * separate event the control never saw. So the scene is told this press and drag are no drag
 * gesture, and the announcement is never made — and should one come anyway, it stops here.
