 * A bass that sits under everything else: barely detuned, so the low end stays one note instead of
 * beating against itself, a closed filter that moves very little, and a sine an octave below
 * carrying the fundamental. Long sustain, short release — a four-to-the-floor bass line under a
 * kick.
