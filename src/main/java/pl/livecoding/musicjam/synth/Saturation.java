/**
 * The shapes a signal can be driven into. Drive has always said how hard; this says what kind.
 *
 * <p>{@link #DIODE} is the one every patch here was levelled against and stays the default: an
 * asymmetric exponential diode, which is what a hand reaches for when it wants dirt. The other four
 * are each a different species rather than a different setting - a soft clip, a hard one, a pair of
 * diodes facing each other, and a fold, which stops being clipping altogether and starts adding
 * partials that were never in the sound.
 *
 * <p>Every shape is levelled, so turning the drive up or changing the shape changes the sound and
 * not the loudness. The levels are measured rather than derived - see {@link #gain} - because
 * these curves clip back off much of what they add, by an amount no formula here would guess.
 *
 * <p>What separates them once they are levelled is how much they lift what is quiet. A shape that
 * only deals with the peaks leaves the rest where it was; one that bends the whole curve raises
 * everything to keep its level, which is what makes saturation sound like compression. Measured,
 * as the gain a signal far below the level they were levelled at comes out with, at drive 1 and
 * at drive 2:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Fold      1.35  2.88     only the peaks are turned round; the rest is least touched
 *   Hard      1.78  3.11     flattened rather than folded
 *   Soft      1.95  3.24     the gentlest of the bending shapes
 *   Diode     2.43  4.13     ours, and the default
 *   Tube      2.55  3.11     the one that lifts least once it is driven hard
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>There were nine of these and there are five. The four that went - a rational S, a cubic, the
 * leaning diode and a rounded fold - each sat within a decibel or two of one that stayed, and a
 * knob with nine stops on it that sound like five is worse than a knob with five.
 *
 * <p>They are furthest apart in the middle of the drive knob and converge towards its top, because
 * every one of them is on its way to a square wave by then. The shape is a choice about the middle
 * of the knob; the top of it is where they all agree.
