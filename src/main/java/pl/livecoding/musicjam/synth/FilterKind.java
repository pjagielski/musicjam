 * Which filter a patch is played through. The two are not the same filter at different settings:
 * one has two poles and the other four, and the four-pole one can be taken to where it sings.
 *
 * <p>{@link #TWO_POLE} is what every patch here was written for and stays the default. Its damping
 * is floored, which puts its most resonant setting at Q = 1.58 - a bump of four decibels, of a
 * fixed shape. {@link #LADDER} is the TB-303's arrangement: four poles, and a peak that narrows as
 * it grows and takes the low end away with it, up to a feedback where it oscillates by itself.
