/**
 * What each of a patch's oscillators puts out before anything is done to it. Until now it was a saw
 * and only a saw, which is what a supersaw is made of and is wrong for half of what a bass wants: a
 * square has no even harmonics at all and hollows out under a filter quite differently, and a sine
 * has nothing to filter, so it is the fundamental and nothing else.
 *
 * <p>The saw and the square are band-limited by {@code polyBlep}, so neither folds its top
 * harmonics back down the spectrum as it climbs. The sine needs no such help, having nothing above
 * its fundamental to fold.
 *
 * <p>Each carries the gain that makes it about as loud as the others. Measured through whole voices
 * rather than taken from the textbook figures for one cycle, because what is being matched is
 * several oscillators detuned against each other, summed, driven and filtered. It cannot be exact
 * and is not: a square is odd harmonics only, so a closed filter keeps less of it than of a saw and
 * an open one keeps more, which leaves about two decibels either way across the patches. That is
 * the waveform being a different sound, not the levelling being wrong.
 *
 * <p>The sine is the exception and is deliberately three decibels above where measuring puts it. By
 * root-mean-square it is already the loudest of the three; by ear it is the quietest, because it
 * puts everything it has in one band where a saw spreads the same energy across a dozen, and
 * loudness is summed across bands rather than over the waveform. Matching what is measured would be
 * matching the wrong thing.
