/**
 * Everything {@link NovasawVoice} needs to know to make a sound: the seven unison saws and their
 * movement, the sine an octave below them, the filter and its own envelope, the level's envelope
 * and the drive. What a patch's constructor used to bake into its fields is now a value: stored in
 * a patch, read frame by frame by a voice, or replaced while a note is sounding when a knob moves.
 *
 * <p>{@code unisonGain} and {@code resonanceCompensation} follow from the others, so build these
 * with {@link #of}, which works them out; the canonical constructor is for {@code with...} copies.
