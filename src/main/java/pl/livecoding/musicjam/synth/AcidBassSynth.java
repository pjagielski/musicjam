 * The 303 idea: a low cutoff, resonance high enough to whistle around it, and an envelope that
 * slams the filter open and lets it fall shut within the note. Short decay, almost no sustain, and
 * enough drive to make the peak bite.
 *
 * <p>This patch is only playable since the state-variable filter got its missing damping term back;
 * before that, this much resonance ran away instead of singing.
