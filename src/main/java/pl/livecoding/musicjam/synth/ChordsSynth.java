/**
 * Held chords under a four-to-the-floor kick: the sound the sidechain was made for. It speaks at
 * once (20 ms) so each chord lands with the bar, holds nearly full, and lets go in a third of a
 * second so one chord does not blur into the next. Seven saws spread wide, a little sub for body,
 * the filter open enough to be bright but short of the lead's edge, and a slow shimmer of
 * vibrato. Duck it under the kick and it pumps.
