/**
 * A four-pole diode ladder, which is the filter a TB-303 has and the two-pole state-variable in
 * {@code NovasawDsp.LowpassFilter} is not. Two things separate them, and both are audible.
 *
 * <p>Four poles rather than two, so it falls away at 24 dB an octave instead of 12; and the
 * resonance can be taken far enough to sing rather than merely to lift. The state-variable's
 * damping is floored in a way that puts its ceiling at Q = 1.58, a bump of four decibels. This one
 * is written so that the feedback can be taken to where the filter oscillates on its own.
 *
 * <p>What makes it a <em>diode</em> ladder rather than a transistor one is that each stage is
 * loaded by the stage after it - the ladder's diodes conduct in both directions, so the stages are
 * coupled rather than being four copies of one filter behind a single feedback path. That coupling
 * is folded into the per-stage gains, computed from the last stage backwards:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   G4 = g / (1 + g)
 *   G3 = g / (1 + g - g*G4/2)   and so on down to G1
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>which is the form Zavalishin gives in <em>The Art of VA Filter Design</em> §5.10 and Odin 2's
 * {@code DiodeFilter.cpp} computes in the same order. The whole zero-delay loop then resolves in
 * one division, because the chain's output is linear in its input:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   y4 = &#915;*u + &#963;     with &#915; = G1*G2*G3*G4 and &#963; what the four states contribute
 *   u  = x - k*y4      so   y4 = (&#915;*x + &#963;) / (1 + k*&#915;)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The coefficients are recomputed every frame, which is what lets the cutoff be swept by an
 * envelope without the filter being wrong between blocks.
