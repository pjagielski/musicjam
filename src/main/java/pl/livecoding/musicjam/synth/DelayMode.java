 * How a repeat travels between the ears.

 * <p>{@code MONO} is the plain echo: both sides hear the same repeat at the same moment.
 * {@code PING_PONG} sends the dry signal into the left line only and crosses the two lines'
 * feedback, so repeats bounce left-right-left. {@code STEREO} gives each side its own line and its
 * own time — the right at two thirds of the left — which sets up a cross-rhythm rather than a
 * bounce. {@code TAPE} is one line per side at the same time, with the read position drifting the
 * way a tape machine's does, so the repeats warble and detune slightly as they fade.
