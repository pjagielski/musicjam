/**
 * Where a loop's slices begin, in frames. A loop is cut on its own grid first - so many to a pass,
 * evenly - because that is what its bars say it is. The grid is then let go of a little: a break
 * cut by hand, or played by a drummer, has its hits near the beat rather than on it, and a slice
 * that begins a few milliseconds before its hit begins with the tail of the one before.
 *
 * <p>The hits are found the plainest way there is: the loudest sample of each short hop, and where
 * that jumps from one hop to the next there is the start of something. It is enough to tell a kick
 * from the silence in front of it, which is all that is being asked. Nothing moves unless there is
 * something to move to, and the first slice never moves: it is the top of the pass, and the jam is
 * counting on it.
 *
 * <p>A boundary takes the nearest hit worth having, not the loudest one within reach. The loudest
 * is the wrong rule: a snare two hundred milliseconds away is louder than the hi-hat a boundary is
 * actually sitting on, and a boundary that jumps that far has left its own slice behind. So the
 * strongest rise in the window sets the bar, and the nearest rise that clears half of it wins.
