/**
 * A peak limiter on the master, the last thing before the mix leaves for the device. Until now the
 * mix was clipped hard at the output, which is what a few Performance FX at once - or a loop track,
 * a break being a finished mix rather than one voice - will find quickly.
 *
 * <p>It looks ahead: the mix is held back a couple of milliseconds, and the gain starts coming down
 * the moment a sample too loud for the ceiling enters, so it is already down by the time that
 * sample leaves. That is what lets it catch a transient instead of distorting it. Coming back up is
 * slow enough not to pump, and one gain serves both channels, so a peak on one side does not pull
 * the image over.
 *
 * <p>The gain is set by the loudest sample still in the line, not by the newest one. It has to be:
 * a single loud frame would otherwise nudge the gain for one frame and let the release carry it
 * back up, and the frame would leave the line at full gain - which is the transient the whole
 * arrangement is here to catch.
