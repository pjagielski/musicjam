/**
 * A loop of recorded audio played in time with the jam: the sample is read with a fractional index
 * at whatever rate makes its bars last as long as the jam's, so a break cut at 120 BPM fills the
 * same bars at 128. The rate is asked for every frame, which is what lets a tempo change while it
 * plays re-time the rest of it rather than only the next pass.
 *
 * <p>Faster means higher, as a sampler has always done: what it would take to move the tempo and
 * leave the pitch where it is has a step of its own (12.4).
 *
 * <p>It is ended, rather than left to play out, both when the jam stops and when the next pass
 * starts — over a few milliseconds, since a loop cut dead halfway up a wave clicks.
